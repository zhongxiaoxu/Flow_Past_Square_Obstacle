# Flow_Past_Square_Obstacle

This project develops a two-dimensional solver for a laminar flow past a cylinder with a square cross-section.  The effects of Re and the distance between the square obstacle and the wall on the shedding of vortexes are studied.  Vortex starts shedding from the square cylinder when Re and the distance between the square obstacle and the wall are larger than critical values.  The shedding frequency is around 0.14 regardless of Re and the distance between the obstacle and the wall.
